# 🧾 Calgary HTTP Log Analysis using Python

A Python project that analyzes Apache-style HTTP logs from the Calgary dataset. This was created as a take-home assessment to demonstrate Python skills in parsing, analyzing, and reporting meaningful web traffic insights.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Parse Apache web server logs using Python
- Extract and analyze key insights:
  - ✅ Total bandwidth used per day
  - ✅ HTTP response code distribution
  - ✅ Top requested URLs
  - ✅ Traffic volume by hour
- Practice real-world file parsing and data transformation

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- *Python 3.x*
- *Regular Expressions* (re)
- *Collections* (defaultdict)
- *Jupyter Notebook* (optional for step-by-step execution)

📊 Suggested KPIs for Log Analysis Project

These KPIs measure website performance, user behavior, and server health using your parsed log data:

🔵 1. Total Bandwidth Usage per Day

Measures: Total data (in bytes or MB) transferred each day.

Insight: Helps understand traffic volume and peak usage periods.


🔵 2. Top Requested URLs/Resources

Measures: The most accessed pages or files (like /index.html, /images/logo.png).

Insight: Identifies popular content and user interest.


🔵 3. HTTP Status Code Distribution

Measures: Count of status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 500).

Insight: Helps spot server errors, broken links, or successful requests.


🔵 4. Hourly Traffic Trends

Measures: Number of requests per hour.

Insight: Reveals peak traffic times (e.g., most users visit between 2 PM – 5 PM).


🔵 5. Client/Host with Most Requests

Measures: IP addresses generating the most traffic.

Insight: Identifies top users, bots, or potential abuse.


🔵 6. Failed Requests Rate

Measures: % of requests resulting in error codes (like 4xx or 5xx).

Insight: Shows system health and user experience issues.
